# Puppeteer Email Link Extractor
I get busy sometimes and just need to automate some tasks on the fly. I hooked up this Link Extractor to my RiddleMail client to access the internet for me when I am on the go.

To use it, all you need to do is send a link to an email address. Then route that email address to the Email Link Extractor.

**Note:** To make sure that you aren't just clicking on spam links, add some additional protection and rules to your email route. For example, I make sure that the subject of my email always contains my dog's name before I send it to my Link Extractor.
